# Explainable Product Representations (Behavior-based)

This mini-project explores whether simple behavioral interaction signals
(views, carts, purchases) can form meaningful product-level representations.

## Steps

1. Build aggregated behavioral features per product.
2. Cluster / visualize product behavior patterns.
3. Train a simple popularity model and explain it with SHAP.

## Data

E-commerce behavior dataset from a multi-category store (7 months of events).
